future features:
/ create csv files containing different time resolutions from the original csv file
eg. The original csv file contains readings every 30 seconds
The script will produce a csv file containing readings every n minutes or every n hours per
day
/ get the mean and standard deviation of weather data for every division in a day and save it
in a csv file.
eg. get the mean and standard deviation of weather data for:
    every hour of the day
    every 3 hours of the day
    every quarter of the day
smallest unit is an hour
/ compare the mean and standard deviations between weather data of two days
/ create graphs of the weather for a day from a csv file
eg. a csv file contains weather data per minute. The script will create a graph of weather data
with a resolution of 1 minute.
a csv file contains weather data per 15 minutes. The script will create a graph of weather data
with a resolution of 15 minutes.
