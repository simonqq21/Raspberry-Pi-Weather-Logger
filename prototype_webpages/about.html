			<p>		I am a weather logger application that runs off a Raspberry Pi. I log data from environmental
			sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi that runs me and store them in an SQlite database. Scripts
			are called every time a new day starts to aggregate the weather data and generate an image plot
			and text report of the weather data of each completed day. Another Python program is called by the
			user through the web interface to generate an image plot and text report of the weather data over
			a range of days, and export the data from the database as a csv file. The weather logger and web
			server autostart on each (re)boot, and the web interface is easily accessible over the same network
			as the Raspberry pi.</p>
